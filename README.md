## Overview

The Mushroom Tent Controller is a fully featured environmental control system designed for mushroom cultivation. It integrates multiple sensors (temperature, humidity, CO2) with relay-controlled components to create an ideal growing environment with automated management.

This system provides precise control over growing conditions, data visualization, and remote monitoring capabilities, all accessible through an intuitive web interface.

## Features

- **Environmental Monitoring**
  - Temperature and humidity monitoring via dual DHT22 sensors
  - CO2 level monitoring via SCD40 sensor
  - Real-time data visualization with configurable graphs
  - Historical data logging and export

- **Automated Control**
  - Configurable relay control for various equipment:
    - Grow lights & UV lights
    - Humidifiers
    - Heaters
    - Ventilation fans (tub and in/out)
  - Automated schedules and environmental triggers
  - Manual override capabilities

- **Profile Management**
  - Save, load, and export cultivation profiles
  - Preconfigured profiles for different growing stages (colonization, fruiting)
  - Easily adjustable parameters for each growth stage

- **Network Integration**
  - WiFi configuration with multiple network support
  - MQTT integration for IoT connectivity
  - Smart outlet (Tapo P100) integration

- **System Management**
  - Web-based configuration interface (responsive for all devices)
  - Remote debugging and logging
  - OTA (Over-the-Air) updates
  - System monitoring and diagnostics

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (running Raspbian OS x64 without desktop)
